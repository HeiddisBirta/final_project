I completed a web development bootcamp in 2024 and am now continuing to grow at the Reykjavík Academy of Web Development, diving deeper into design, development, and real-world projects. My background in tourism, elderly care, and retail taught me how to multitask, solve problems, and connect with all kinds of people. Now, I’m ready to channel that into tech—designing and building tools that are as user-friendly as they are functional.",
